Getting started with development
===================================

This page will guide you through everything, that you need to contribute to this project.

Installing
------------------

The projects repository is located at `Gitlab <https://gitlab.com/JulianSobott/mower/>`_.
To clone it to a local repository. Go to the parent where you want the repo placed.
Then type in the console:

.. code-block:: console

    git clone https://gitlab.com/JulianSobott/mower.git

The code is written in python, so you need python 3.7+ installed.
If you haven't get it from `python.org <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_.
Make sure, that you check `install pip`.

The easiest thing to set everything up, is to use pipenv. To install `pipenv` type:

.. code-block:: console

    pip install pipenv

Now that you have `pipenv` installed, you can install all necessary dependencies in a virtualenv.

.. code-block:: console

    pipenv install

Generate the docs
--------------------

The docs are generated by `sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/>`_. To generate them, first enter the
virtualenv in you console.

.. code-block:: console

    pipenv shell

Then you can generate the html sites.

.. code-block:: console

    cd docs
    make html

You should see the results in `mower/docs/_build/html`.
You can open the `index.html` in your browser and watch the generated documentation.
If you are working in PyCharm you can right-click the `index.html` file and select *run* to run it at the localhost in
your browser. No advantage, maybe more easy, then searching in the file explorer for the file.

Start coding
---------------

Before you start coding, make sure that you read the :doc:`index`.
