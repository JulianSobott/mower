    - Define interface between simulation, core and real
    - Map
        - load map
        - Save map
    - Generalize sensor data

- Image recognition
    - Collect training and test images
    - Real time recognition
    - General recognition
        - Define what to recognize  and how to handle it
        - Create an algorithm with proper output
            - Define the outputs and inputs

- Simulation
    - Mower can drive
        - Extends the core drive functionality
    - Controls
